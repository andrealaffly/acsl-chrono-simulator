# ACSL Chrono Simulator

[![BSD License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## üìö Overview

This package is a C++ implementation of Project Chrono that provides a high fidelity physics engine to perform hardware in-the-loop simulations with the freeware, open-source, PX4 compatible [**ACSL Flightstack Winged**](https://github.com/andrealaffly/ACSL-flightstack-winged). The main purpose of this package is to leverage the simulation environment to test out various **GNC** (Guidance, Navigation and Control) algorithms prior to real-world flights to save on time and to debug the pipeline.

### System Requirements

- **Processor:** Intel
- **RAM:** At least 16 GB
- **GPU:** Nvidia
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
